Orca Slicer is a fork of Bambu Studio. It was previously known as BambuStudio-SoftFever.  
Bambu Studio is based on [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research, which is from [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community. 
Orca Slicer incorporates a lot of features from SuperSlicer by @supermerill

# How to install
**Windows**: 
1.  Unzip the binaries to any folder you prefer, then execute orca-slicer.exe to start the application.  
    - *If you have troubles to run the build, you might need to install following runtimes:*
      - [MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64](https://github.com/SoftFever/BambuStudio-SoftFever/releases/download/v1.0.10-sf2/MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe)  
      - [vcredist2019_x64](https://github.com/SoftFever/BambuStudio-SoftFever/releases/download/v1.0.10-sf2/vcredist2019_x64.exe)  

**Mac**:

2. Double click to unzip the package, move OrcaSlicer.app to Application folder.

    ```
  - Option 2:  
      - Step 1: open the app, a warning window will pop up
